## Setup
< write in more detail>
1. Download Python 3.6 or later
2. Install Jupyter Notebook
3. Use the included requirements.txt to install the libraries
4. Clone this repository 

## Tutorial outline
1. What is model calibration and why do we need it?
2. How to measure calibration?
  * Reliability diagrams
  * Expected calibration error
  * Maximum calibration error
  * nPlanâ€™s RMS calibration error
  * Adapting these to multiclass problems
3. How to calibrate classification models?
  * Temperature scaling
  * Platt scaling
  * Matrix and vector scaling
4. How can we use this in real life situations?
